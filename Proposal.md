# Rave Jewelry

I propose to build bracelets and/or necklaces (or even glasses) that respond to sound by creating colors with leds in the jewelry. 

## Summary

Using a sound sensor and leds, I will create a fun new accessory to take with you to music festivals and other loud events. The sound sensor will be incorporated into the design of this piece of wearable technology and be connected to a strip of Smart RGB+White LEDs. Changes in volume are detected by comparing the converter's result to a threshold value that we include in our program. Using thresholds, I will set three different volume categories to adjust the NeoPixel's color accordingly.
The main goal of this project is to create a piece of working, fun wearable technology. The louder the sound, the more lights you will see! Perhaps it will also flow with the beat of the music. 


Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts

I will be buying:
1 Maxim Integrated MX4466 amplifier breakout
1 Adafruit NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - White 60 LED - WHITE
1 Arduino Nano or Uno
1 Micro USB cable
1 AA battery pack
1 Hookup wire

There is a single pin for input and a single pin for output. 
Include what types of inputs/outputs/data it will use, and a block diagram showing how all those pieces are connected.
