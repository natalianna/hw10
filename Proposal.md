# Rave Jewelry

I propose to build bracelets and/or necklaces (or even glasses) that respond to sound by creating colors with leds in the jewelry. 

## Summary

Using a sound sensor and leds, I will create a fun new accessory to take with you to music festivals and other loud events. The sound sensor will be incorporated into the design of this piece of wearable technology and be connected to a strip of Smart RGB+White LEDs. Changes in volume are detected by comparing the converter's result to a threshold value that we include in our program. Using thresholds, I will set three different volume categories to adjust the NeoPixel's color accordingly.
The main goal of this project is to create a piece of working, fun wearable technology. The louder the sound, the more lights you will see! Perhaps it will also flow with the beat of the music. 


Include a discussion how it will be interactive or responsive to the environment.

## Component Parts

I will be buying:
1 Maxim Integrated MX4466 amplifier breakout,
1 Adafruit NeoPixel Digital RGB LED Strip - White 60 LED - WHITE,
1 Arduino Nano or Uno,
1 Micro USB cable,
1 AA battery pack,
1 Hookup wire,

## Challenges

My understanding of Arduino itself is limited and my knowledge of the materials I'm going to purchase is minimal. I expect I will need some time to learn about how everything works before I'm ready to create the final product. I would also like to develop my knowledge of drawing these systems which could help me greatly in understanding the material. 

## Timeline

What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible! 

- Week 1: Write proposal
- Week 2: Order materials
- Week 3: Become familiar with the materials and begin working on final product
- Week 4: Bring in first draft of final product and tweek until it works as desired
- Week 5: Present!
